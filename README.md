Requirements
------------

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io)
- [scilpy](https://github.com/scilus/scilpy)

Singularity/Docker
-----------
If you are on Linux, we recommend using the Singularity to run tractometry_flow pipeline.
If you have Apptainer (Singularity), launch your Nextflow command with:
`-with-singularity ABSOLUTE_PATH/scilus-2.1.0.sif`

Image is available [here](http://scil.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/en/containers_list/scilus-2.1.0.sif)

If you are on MacOS or Windows, we recommend using the Docker container to run tractometry_flow pipeline.
Launch your Nextflow command with:
`-with-docker scilus/scilus:2.1.0`

:warning: WARNING :warning:
---------
The official release 2.1.0 is **NOT** available now.

Please, either build the singularity container using this command:

`singularity build scilus_latest.sif docker://scilus/scilus:latest` 

and then launch your Nextflow command with:
`-with-singularity ABSOLUTE_PATH/scilus_latest.sif`

Or launch your Nextflow command with docker:
`-with-docker scilus/scilus:latest`
