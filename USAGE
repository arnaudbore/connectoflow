Connectoflow pipeline
=====================

Run our state-of-the-art connectivity pipeline.
T1 and labels must be provided in their original space (output from freesurfer
or civet) and the affine and nonlinear transformation must bring these images
to diffusion space. We recommand running the command scil_verify_space_attributes_compatibility
with the t1 and labels to ensure they are indeed in the same space.

The atlas must be stripped of the WM and CSF labels and only keep the cortical and
subcortical labels (brainstem/cerebelum optional).

The rest of the input (tracking, dwi, peaks, fodf and all metrics)
must be in diffusion space with compatible headers. We recommand running the command 
scil_verify_space_attributes_compatibility with the all the files mentioned above
to ensure they are indeed in the same space.

It is mandatory that all grouped input either have identical prefix or no
prefix at all.

- *labels.nii.gz and t1.nii.gz must have the same prefix in order to be read properly.
    t1 MUST overlay with the labels and MUST be skull-strip.
    If you launched Tractoflow using the same input T1w image. Then, connectoflow 'expects'
    the T1w from the BET_T1 process.

- *dwi.nii.gz, *dwi.bval, *dwi.bvec, *fodf.nii.gz, *peaks.nii.gz must also have
the same prefix in order to be read properly.
    If you launched Tractoflow, the dwi.nii.gz comes from RESAMPLE_DWI and if you used
    Eddy make sure to use the corrected bvecs from the EDDY process.

- *tracking*.[fib,trk,tck] must also have the same prefix.
This support multiple files (with suffixes).

If you do not provide dwi.nii.gz/bval/bvec, use --run_commit false
If you do not provide fodf, use --run_afd_rd false
If you use a large number of cpu per node (e.g >20) makes sure the option
--processes_avg_similarity is set to that number to use all the cpu of the node.

Most processes have a duration directly related to the number of connections.
Which is (NBR_PARCEL) * (NBR_PARCEL-1) / 2. Running connectoflow with a freesurfer
parcellation is A LOT faster than with Brainnetome, which is A LOT faster than
with Glasser, make sure to test & optimize calls before launching on clusters.

If providing a lesion mask, the nifti should be a uint8 binary image representing
the voxel that are considered lesions. These lesions should have been taken into account
when generating the tractogram (to allow tractography within the lesions).
The lesion mask MUST BE in the same space as the DWI with the same header.

AVAILABLE PROFILES (using -profile option (e.g. -profile use_cuda,fully_reproducible))

macos                                       When this profile is used, TractoFlow will modify a parameter (scratch) for MacOS users.

fully_reproducible                          When this profile is used, all the parameters will be set to have 100% reproducible results.
   

NOTES

To set the number of parallel processes to launch, please use:
'nextflow run -qs {nb_processes}'.

The intermediate working directory is, by default, set to './work'.
To change it, use the '-w WORK_DIR' argument.

The default config file is connectoflow/nextflow.config.
Use '-C config_file.config' to specify a non-default configuration file.
The '-C config_file.config' must be inserted after the nextflow call
like 'nextflow -C config_file.config run ...'.
